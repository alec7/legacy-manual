# Overlays

You can make overlays and attach it to OS.js instead of using the codebase directories.

This works for:

* Server modules (Node and PHP)
* Template files (for dist)
* Packages
* Client codebase overlays

See https://github.com/andersevenrud/osjs-example-overlay for an example.

After you've added an overlay just use the build system like normal. Note that watches also work for overlays.
